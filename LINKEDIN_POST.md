**Headline:** 🚀 transforming Monoliths to Microservices: A Journey to Scalable Architecture

I'm excited to share that I've successfully migrated our Task Application from a standard Docker Compose setup to a robust **Microservices Architecture** orchestrated by **Kubernetes**! 🏗️

**Why the shift?**
As applications grow, scalability and resilience become non-negotiable. By decoupling our frontend, backend, and database into independent services, we've unlocked:

✅ **Independent Scaling**: We can now scale our Node.js backend separately from our React frontend based on traffic demands.
✅ **Resilience**: A failure in one component doesn't bring down the entire system.
✅ **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Thanks to Kubernetes rolling updates.

**The Tech Stack:**
*   **Frontend**: React + Vite (served via Nginx)
*   **Backend**: Node.js + Express
*   **Database**: MySQL 8.0 with Persistent Volumes
*   **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Deployments, Services, Ingress)
*   **Gateway**: Nginx Ingress Controller
